Small actionable tasks (please remove if you complete them):

- Change module declaration style from current:
    (function (app) { ... })(angular.module(...));
  Into more desirable approach:
    (function () { var module = angular.module(..); ... })();
  Advantages:
    - module declaration at the top
    - variable name more explicit
    - module variable is scoped to function, no risk of being overridden

Larger tasks (may require prioritisation with PO input):

- Revisit our feature toggle approach:
  - improve redact to handle embedded ifs - supports "hiding" that we're working on something
  OR
  - change feature solution to make 'feature' available at runtime
