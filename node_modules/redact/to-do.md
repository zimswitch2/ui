# redact's to-do list

- create a README.md
- check why auto-push to npm is not working
- negation—e.g.```!feature.blabla```
- combination with ANDs and ORs—e.g. ```if (something === 'etc' && feature.blabla)```
- ```else```—```if (feature.something) something(); else somethingElse();``` should remove the ```else``` and yield only ```somethingElse();```
- CSS support?
